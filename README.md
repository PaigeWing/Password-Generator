This password generator was developed to allow users the ability to generate a secure password while getting to choose what they want to include in their password.

Easy Steps

The generator is easy to follow. Once the “Generate Password” is clicked, the user will then be prompted to answer questions to have the code build their desired password. Below is a short description of the questions prompted.

1.	How long they would like their password to be as long as it is within 8-128 characters.
2.	If they would like their password to include uppercase letters.
3.	If they would like their password to include lowercase letters.
4.	If they would like their password to include numbers.
5.	If they would like their password to include special characters.

Once they are done with the prompts the new password will automatically generate in the box on the screen.
